      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been doing some work with Microsoft Intune - specifically around Conditional Access, Azure AD and Intune. There are plenty of guides online for getting a Fiddler trace of HTTPS traffic between Android and a back end, but they all require you to have your Windows Laptop on the same network as your Android device. In a modern corporate network architecture that isn&amp;rsquo;t easy. The Microsoft support team, my customer network, and my conracting company network were all locked down preventing this setup.
