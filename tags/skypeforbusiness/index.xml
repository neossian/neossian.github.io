      <description>When I perform schema changes in very large forests it is nice to be able to track the status of the change as it replicates throughout the forest. I wanted to create a script that would quickly tell me what the current schema was on over 100 DCs.
If you don&amp;rsquo;t want to see how it was done you can just Download Track-LyncSchema.ps1
Starting with some scripts that I have built before foreach-parallel to do parallel processing, get-forestDomainControlles to get a list of all DCs in the forest and get-LdapData to do direct ldap lookups quickly.</description>
