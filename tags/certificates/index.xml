      <description>When replacing certificates on servers it is nice to be able to verify that the certificate has been updated after you have done the change.

With websites this tends to be very easy - enter the address in Internet Explorer and doubleclick the padlock to view the certificate. This doesn&amp;rsquo;t work in lots of situations though - no IE available in the environment, when you are trying to use a particular SNI header that doesn&amp;rsquo;t match your connectivity method on your client machine, or when you want to get a secure LDAP certificate - port 636 or 3269 from a Domain Controller.</description>
