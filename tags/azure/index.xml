      <description>Azure conditional access provides flexible control over access to Office 365 resources and services based on location/user group membership/device etc. If you set up conditional access rules, any user who doesn&amp;rsquo;t have an Azure AD Premium license will not be affected by them - access is permitted by default!
How to work around this without manually assigning licenses to every user or using a dodgy script? Azure AD has a capability called Dynamic Groups.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Azure conditional access provides amazingly flexible control over access to Office 365 resources and services based on location/user group membership/device etc. Leveraging it to block access generally requires EMS (Enterprise Mobility + Security) licenses for all users. This short script will assign EMS licenses to all users in your tenant who are licensed but do not have EMS yet.
